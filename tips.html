          <h2>Be Knowledgeable</h2>
          <p>
            It’s always a good idea to do some researchon local language,
            currency, customs and other information about the area you are
            visiting. If you overlook one of these, you may unconsciously insult
            someone, miss a flight, be caught someplace with no purchasing
            power, or have no way to communicate with the locals.
          </p>
          <h2>Master Your Travel Necessities</h2>
          <p>
            aking care of all your travel must-haves before you hit the
            concourse will take a load off your mind. For most people, the
            adventure of finding a hidden waterfall is much more satisfying than
            the adventure of finding basic toiletries upon arrival. Cover your
            bases so you can focus on the fun adventures. Organize all travel
            docs (passport, visas, IDs, copy of important documents, etc.) Keep
            your money close at hand—and out of others’ hands (check out travel
            security options, such as a money belt, if you’ll be going somewhere
            where this is an issue) Carry your toiletries in TSA approved
            bottles and store them in a clear pouch to make going through
            security a breeze
          </p>
          <h2>Enjoy the Freedom of Traveling Light</h2>
          <p>
            “We become what we behold. We shape our tools, and thereafter our
            tools shape us.” - Marshall McLuhan It’s pretty common to over pack
            for an adventure, whether it’s checking out the fall leaves of New
            Hampshire or traveling through southern Chile. Take a look at what
            you’re planning to pack. You can bring it all, but if you do, you’ll
            have to carry it everywhere you go. Believe it or not, it’s more
            than possible to visit nearby locations and faraway destinations
            with only a carry on.
          </p>
          <h2>Bring the Right Gear</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re going to invest in adventure travel, make sure you have
            everything you need to make it a success. Here's a few suggestions:
            If you’re going to be backpacking it’s important to find a
            comfortable, lightweight backpack If you’re going to take
            daytripsconsider a packable backpack or daypack to use so you don’t
            have to carry all of your stuff with you If your trip involves
            hiking, make sure you have high quality, durable trekking boots that
            will last for the duration of your trip If you’re going to be
            working out a lotyou may want to bring compression socks to keep
            your legs from swelling (they can also be worn on your flight) If
            you’re going to be carrying around sweaty, dirty, or muddy gear,make
            sure you have something to carry it in that will keep it away from
            the rest of your stuff, like the Pack-It Clean Dirty Cube
          </p>
          <h2>Prepare for Physically Challenging Adventures</h2>
          <p>
            Thinking of scaling the tallest mountain in North America? Venturing
            through Death Valley? You might want to prepare accordingly. Here
            are a few examples: Get in shape - feeling strong and up to the
            challenge will help you enjoy the experience more Bring the right
            fuel – make sure you have enough energy bars and protein drinks to
            maintain stamina Don’t forget about altitude –if there will be a
            huge change in altitude, you may need to plan to get acclimated or
            talk to a travel clinic about getting yourself some preventive
            medicine.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="article" id="article-2">
          <h2>Preparation</h2>
          <p>
            Preparation is key. Mistakes happen, even to experienced pilots.
            However, maintaining a respect for flying coupled with a constant
            feeling of susceptibility and preparing yourself properly physically
            and mentally before paragliding is very important. This includes
            compiling an accurate weather forecast ahead of your flight and
            knowing the area well. All paragliding equipment should be inspected
            regularly and before each flight to ensure it is up to proper
            working standards. If you have any question about the integrity of
            any of your equipment, or the conditions in which you will be
            paragliding, do not take off. Also, practice your techniques for
            both launching and landing. When landing, you should do so into the
            wind. It is important to practice your landing and concentrate your
            efforts on hitting the target, or as close as possible. After all,
            practice makes perfect and you will be happy you have gone through
            all the details ahead of time once you reach the ground safely. You
            should also have a plan for the end of your flight before you even
            begin. Properly planning a safe approach to the landing zone should
            be a priority at every step of your flight, and you should avoid
            landing out of the zone, which increases the likelihood of an
            accident.
          </p>
          <h2>Avoid Complacency</h2>
          <p>
            0ne of the biggest mistakes people make after they begin paragliding
            regularly is to fall into a pattern of complacency. The sport is
            both thrilling and relaxing, which is a unique combination
            responsible for many people enjoying it so much. It is also pretty
            easy to reach a level of competency, which can lead to over
            confidence. In the anticipation of flying however, some people
            forget that they will be flying high through the air, which is by
            its very definition death defying. There are certainly risks that
            must be planned for and respected at every level of the flying
            experience. By making the proper preparations and making use of our
            paragliding safety tips, you can ensure a safe and enjoyable flight.

          <h2>Prepare Yourself Mentally</h2>
          <p>
            A lot of people insist that they’ll pass out. They don’t. A lot of
            people think it’ll be easy for them. Sometimes, they’re a lot more
            challenged than they thought. Loads of first-time tandem skydivers
            are sure they’ll freak out in freefall. Usually, they’re amazed to
            discover that not only are they fine, they love it–and some land
            only to sign up for a solo skydiving certification program
            straightaway. Often, fear of skydiving just echoes fear of the
            unknown. Sure, skydiving is scary–but it’s the kind of managed risk
            that’s very, very healthy to face. Remember: Not knowing how you’ll
            feel is okay. The important part is that you try. Statistically
            speaking, hear this: You’re braver and more adventurous than you
            give yourself credit for.
          </p>
          <h2>Dress Approriately</h2>
          <p>
            Dressing for a skydive is super-simple. Start at the bottom with
            comfortable, tight-lacing tennis shoes. (Bear this in mind: if your
            shoes are loose, the wind will grab them right off your feet, so
            double-check that they’re nice and snug before you get on the
            plane.) Next, wear the right pants. Ideally, the kind of pants (or
            shorts) you’d wear to the gym are the kind of pants you should wear
            on a skydive, because you need them to be reasonably stretchy, with
            more room to move than jeans usually bequeath. For your top, choose
            to wear snug-fitting layers. (Bring a long-sleeved top layer even if
            it’s warm, just in case.) In general, wear clothes without any
            strings, metal grommets, rhinestones, pompoms or other details that
            might flap around painfully or be pulled off by the wind.

          <h2>Rafting</h2>
          <h2>Know Proper Swimming techniques</h2>
          <p>
            When swimming in the river, whether you fall out or you jump in for
            fun, there are two techniques. The first is the “Down River Swimmers
            Position”. This is on your back, nose and toes to the sky with your
            head up so you can see where you are going. Feet down stream with
            your knees slightly bent. This way if you come in contact with a
            rock you can use your feet and legs as shock absorbers and push off
            the rock. Arms should be out to your side to help keep yourself in
            control. A helpful hint here: keep your butt up. If you sit with
            your butt low in the water, you will find a rock and bring home some
            interesting bruises. Guys, keep your legs together. If you hit a
            rock we call this “romancing the stone. “ There is no romance for a
            couple of weeks afterwards. The second swimmers position is becoming
            more popular and more excepted in rescue situations. This position
            is on your stomach doing your best Michael Phelps impersonation.
            Point to where you want to go and go. Swim until you are out of the
            river. Again your guide will explain when it is best to use which
            swimming position. If you choose to swim to the shore, swim all the
            way to the shore. NEVER stand up in moving current. Most guides
            never walk in water over their shins. This prevents a situation
            called “Foot Entrapment” which is where you put your size 9 foot in
            a size 8 hole or crack in the bottom of the river. This is not a
            good place to be but it is so easy not to get in this situation,
            just don’t walk in the river. It is just that easy.
          </p>
          <h2>Kayaking</h2>

          <h2>believe in yourself</h2>
          <p>
            One of the greatest challenges facing a first time bungy jumper is
            getting their minds around the fact they are about to jump off a
            perfectly good tower. It's not a natural thing to do, and there will
            be nerves. First time jumpers need to embrace this feeling, have
            confidence in themselves, and know that they CAN do this. The only
            thing standing in their way is themselves.
          </p>
          <h2>Dont believe the myths!</h2>
          <p>
            Like many extreme adventure activities, bungy over the years has
            accumulated many urban myths. Your eyes won't fall out of your head
            and your back won't snap! Myths are normally created by those too
            scared to take the challenge and trying to find a easy way out!
          </p>
          <h2>trust the jump master</h2>
          <p>
            Our Jump Masters go through a long, in-depth training schedule to
            become a qualified Jump Master. Jump with the Jump Master's

        <div class="article" id="article-6">
          <h2>Want better air consumption? Log more dives!</h2>
          <p>
            Air hog. That is what they call the diver whose tank has the least
            amount of air in it at the end of a dive. This label often falls on
            the new diver. Don’t worry; it’s natural to breathe more when you’re
            excited – and what’s more exciting than your first dive? The good
            news is, your air consumption will improve. As you gain more
            experience, you become more comfortable with your gear, and buoyancy
            starts to become second nature
          </p>
          <h2>It’s important to go slow</h2>
          <p>
            Add air to your BC in small increments, wait a few seconds and see
            how the air you added changes your buoyancy. Add a few puffs, take a
            few breaths and, after a few fin kicks, reassess. Slowly adding air
            to your BC keeps your dive profile from looking like the zigzags on
            a saw blade. Remember: don’t add air to your BC to ascend. Use your
            fins instead and slowly release expanding air
          </p>
          <h2>Don’t fall victim to peer pressure</h2>
          <p>
            Any diver can call off any dive for any reason, no questions asked
            (or answered).” Taking up scuba diving is a great way to push your
            personal boundaries. While you want to embrace new things, don’t
            allow others to pressure you into doing something that doesn’t feel
            right. Do what you enjoy, not what others want you to do
          </p>
          <h2>Get a well-fitting mask</h2>
          <p>
            There’s nothing more uncomfortable than a leaking mask that smashes
            your ears or face. The whole point of diving is to see what’s going
            on underwater. If your mask is always leaking, it’s a distraction
            and impairs your vision. For an optimal scuba experience, begin with
            choosing a mask fitted by a professional. A properly fitting mask
            keeps you focused and makes your dive more enjoyable
          </p>

        <div class="article" id="article-7">
          <h2>Preview and Read the Route</h2>
          <p>
            Before you climb, visualize the sequences through the entire
            route--or as much as you can see from the ground. Anticipate weight,
            balance, reach, and each move through the route. Here is the key:
            find the crux and decide the position you need to be in to complete
            it. Work backwards down the route. Make mental notes where your left
            and right hands and feet are positioned. When you climb, start the
            sequence going into the crux so your hands and feet and body is
            positioned correctly when you reach the crux
          </p>
          <h2>Strength of Grip</h2>
          <p>
            Relax. Over-gripping will wear out your forearms and when that
            happens, you are done. The grip is not often thought of as an
            attribute of good rock climbing technique, and few climbers give a
            second thought. However it’s well known that the grip is first
            muscle group to go. Your back and shoulders must remain loose and
            relaxed. Get into the habit of mentally checking your grip in tough
            situations. Remain conscious of your grip and the strength you use
            to hold yourself in place to make your movement more fluid and
            improve your endurance, balance and climbing performance
          </p>
          <h2>Keep Your Body Close to the Wall</h2>
          <p>
            You should also keep your center of gravity balanced in a
            forward-backward direction. In other words, toward the wall or away
            from the wall. As a rule, keep your body close to the wall.
            Understandably, sometimes leaning back away from the wall is
            necessary to see the route. There is no set distance because of the
            variety of types of moves and hand holds in climbing. In most cases,
            the more accurate you need to be with your balance the closer to the
            wall your body and face should be.
          </p>
          <h2>Find Rest Spots</h2>
          <p>
            Regardless of the speed of climbing, climbers who look for and take
            rests will do better than those who do not. Learning to spot and
            take advantage of rest spots is a very important technique in rock
            climbing.

          <h2>Shoulders over knees</h2>
          <p>
            We ski instructors often tell people to get into an “athletic
            stance” when skiing. This generally means flexing slightly in all
            the joints in a position of readiness… kind of like a soccer goalie
            or a tennis player ready to move anywhere at a moments’ notice. One
            way to gage if you are maintaining and athletic balanced stance is
            if you keep your shoulders over your knees. This is of course just a
            rule of thumb and there are always situations in skiing where you
            can break the rules, especially at higher performance levels… but
            for the average skier if your shoulders are over your knees, that’s
            a pretty good place to be.

          <h2>Turn with the legs</h2>
          <p>
            Many intermediate and even advanced skiers initiate their turns by
            rotating their upper body. This can easily get you out of balance
            and put you in a position where it becomes difficult to effectively
            edge the skis. Instead try turning with the legs (rotate the femurs
            inside the hip sockets). This will allow you to keep a quiet upper
            body to maintain balance. It will also allow you to more effectively
            create “angulation”
          </p>
          <h2>Inclination vs Angulation</h2>
          <p>
            The faster you go and sharper you turn the more inclination you will
            need. This is all fine and dandy, but most of time inclination alone
            is not enough. In order to increase your edging without falling over
            you will need to add “angulation” into the mix. This simply means
            creating angles in your body. Essentially you are counter balancing
            the movement of your knees and hips to the inside by moving your
            shoulders and upper body towards the outside of the turn. This way
            you can increase the edge angle without further increasing the
            inclination. I like to think of angulation like folding your body
            into a “C” shape. Trying to keep your chin over your outside toe
            piece towards the end of each turn will help you feel this
            sensation.
          </p>
          <h2>Be mobile</h2>
          <p>
            An “athletic stance” is great but skiing like a robot is going to
            give you a rough ride. Good skiers are dynamic and always moving in
            order to maintain balance and control pressure. A good way to work
            on balance and mobility is to ski through all those bumps and jumps
            on the side of a run. Try to go over bigger bumps while keeping your
            skis on the snow. You will need to bend and extend the joints in
            different combinations for each situation… lots of fun!
