				<h3>Delay, Cancellation or Change of Itinerary by Adventure Trails</h3>
				<p>Adventure Trails India Pvt. Ltd. reserves the right to cancel any expedition prior to departure (including, but not limited to, by reason of too few people booking on any tour) in which case participants will be given a refund in full. However, you will not be entitled to make any further claim for any injury, loss, expenses or damage (either direct or consequential) or for any loss of time or inconvenience which may result from such cancellation (including but not limited to visa, passport and vaccination charges, or departure, gear purchases, airport and airline taxes).</p>

				<h3>Cancellation by Participant</h3>
				<p>If it becomes necessary to cancel your tour, you must notify Adventure Trails India Pvt. Ltd. immediately in writing. Once we receive your notice, cancellation will take effect. Please note that the following charges will apply on cancellation:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>if cancellation takes place more than 45 days prior to departure, your full deposit will be returned except a processing charge of Rs. 5000</li>
				<li>if cancellation takes place between 45 and 30 days prior to departure, 50% of the tour price will be forfeited and</li>
				<li>if cancellation takes place less than 30 days prior to departure, 100% of the tour price will be forfeited.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Some trips attract a minimum processing charge â€“ please check.</p>
				<p>The tour price is quoted as a package. No partial refunds or credit will be given for services not used. We recommend that you obtain travel insurance upon booking.	</p>

				<h3>Health and Fitness Requirements</h3>
				<p>Participants must be in good health and reasonable physical condition. It is vital that participants with medical problems make them known to us well before departure. If you suffer from severe muscular, chest, heart or bronchial disorders, or if you are a severe asthmatic, or have high blood pressure, you are strongly advised against participating. Expeditions generally take place in remote areas where there is little or no access to normal medical services or hospital facilities for serious problems. Where necessary, evacuation can be prolonged, difficult and expensive. Medical and evacuation expenses will be the responsibility of the participant.</p>

				<h3>Insurance</h3>
				<p>Personal travel insurance is not included in the tour price. We strongly recommend that you take out travel insurance including cancellation insurance upon booking.</p>

				<h3>Route Changes/Postponement or Delay</h3>
				<p>Adventure Trails India Pvt. Ltd. may for any reason change the date of departure or conclusion of the tour, or it is possible that a route change, postponement or delay (either in relation to departure or to the duration of the expedition) may become necessary due to inclement weather, snow and ice conditions, political restrictions or any other cause. In the event of a change, postponement or delay, participants have no right to refund of the tour price (in whole or in part) or other compensation for any injury, loss or damage.</p>

				<h3>Package Prices</h3>
				<p>Package prices are based on ground costs, airfares. Adventure Trails India Pvt. Ltd. tries its utmost not to increase tour prices (in full or part), however sometimes increases are outside its control. We reserve the right to amend tour prices (or any part) without notice at any time before and including the departure date. Amendments may be necessitated for many reasons including, but not limited to, exchange rate fluctuations, increased fuel costs, airfares, airport charges etc. Any increase in tour prices must be paid prior to the departure date.</p>

				<p>The following items are excluded from the tour price:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>visa, passport and vaccination charges</li>
				<li>departure, airport and airline taxes</li>
				<li>extra meals not included in the itinerary</li>
				<li>laundry, postage, personal clothing, medical expenses, personal travel insurance and items of a personal nature</li>
				<li>emergency evacuation charges and</li>
				<li>tips and excess baggage charges.</li>

				</ul>

				<h3>Responsibility/Liability</h3>
				<p>THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY</p>
				<p>I acknowledge and confirm the following:</p>
				<p>I waive any and all claims I may now and in the future have against, and release from all liability and agree not to sue Adventure Trails India Pvt. Ltd. and its officers, employees, guides, agents or representatives (collectively its staff) or the licensor for any personal injury, death, property damage, or loss sustained by me as a result of my participation in an adventure trip with them, due to any cause whatsoever, including without any limitation, negligence on the part of Adventure Trails India Pvt. Ltd., its staff and licensor. I am aware that your adventure trip, in addition to the usual dangers and risks inherent, has certain additional dangers and risks, some of which may include: physical exertion for which I may not be prepared; weather extremes subject to sudden and unexpected change; remoteness from normal medical services; evacuation difficulties if I am disabled.</p>
				<p>I accept all the inherent risks of the proposed adventure trip and the possibility of personal injury, death or property damage or loss resulting therefrom. I acknowledge that the enjoyment and excitement of adventure travel is derived in part from the inherent risks incurred by travel and the activity beyond the accepted safety of life at home or work, and that these inherent risks contribute to such enjoyment and excitement, being a reason for my participation.</p>
				<p>I agree that if I suffer injury or illness Adventure Trails India Pvt. Ltd, can, at my cost, arrange medical treatment and emergency evacuation service, as they deem essential for my safety. In entering into this Agreement, I am not relying on any oral, written nor visual representations or statements by Adventure Trails India Pvt. Ltd. or its staff or any other inducement or coercion to go on an adventure trip, hence, only of my own free will. I confirm that I have read and understood the terms and conditions of contract and this Agreement prior to signing it and agree that this Agreement will be binding upon my heirs, next of kin, executors, administrators and successors.</p>
